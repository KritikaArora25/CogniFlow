0000****000*******What we need for Cogniflow?******000*******0000

Core features for backend:
1.	User authentication & JWT – you’ve done this ✅
2.	User data – track users, their profiles, roles (student/admin if needed) ✅
3.	Cognitive score tracking – store scores per user ✅
4.	Weekly study plan generation – integrate GPT, based on scores 
5.	Protected routes – only logged-in users can access their scores or plans 
Think of backend as 3 main layers:
•	Models (DB) → How we store data
•	Controllers (Logic) → What happens when user hits a route
•	Routes (Endpoints) → How frontend talks to backend


***********Cognitive Score Logic*************

Coaching step: Think in “what user does → what backend stores”

Frontend: user studies → track activity → send data (score, distractions, focusedTime)

Backend: receive POST request → save to DB linked to user

Route: POST /api/scores

Controller: validate input → save → return saved score




*******************GPT Integration for Weekly Plan************************

Step-by-step thinking:

Need latest cognitive score

Send it to GPT (OpenAI API) → ask “Generate a weekly study plan for this user”

Save plan in DB with week number

Return plan to frontend

💡 Coaching tip: Don’t code GPT immediately. First test by returning a dummy plan like "Study 2 hours/day" to make sure route works. Then integrate GPT.



*************Routes & Controllers**************

Coaching mindset: “Each route does one thing clearly”

authRoutes: signup, login

scoreRoutes: submit score, get all scores

gptRoutes: generate weekly plan, get past plans

userRoutes: get/update profile

Check: Every route that needs a logged-in user → wrap with protect middleware.



*******************Test Everything Step by Step*****************

Use Postman or Thunder Client

Test signup/login first → check JWT

Test protected route → verify token works

Test submit score → verify DB entry

Test generate weekly plan → verify DB entry

Always build incrementally. Don’t jump to GPT integration until the “normal backend” works perfectly.


************************************************
Refine Score Logic

Right now you’re just saving raw values.

Next, we can add focus score calculation (based on idleTime, tabSwitches, activityTime).

That’s where “Cogniflow” starts becoming smart.

Frontend Integration

Hook your React frontend → connect login, register, submit score, view scores.

Test end-to-end flow: login → study → submit score → see results.

Extras (later, once stable):

Leaderboards (compare users)

Weekly focus reports (charts)

GPT integration to give study tips based on scores
